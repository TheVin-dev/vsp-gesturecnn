#Neural network gesture classification:

## Inputs
We want to use the Pose, the left hand and the right hand. 
For the Pose, we will use 11 t/m 22 landmarks.
For the hands we use all landmarks. (21 + 21) = 42 landmarks 

every landmark has 4 variables (x,y,z,visibility) 

So in total, there will be 4 * (42 + 11) (float) inputs to the NN. 
There are 4 outputs, the chosen gestures.
